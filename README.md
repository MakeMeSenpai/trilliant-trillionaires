## What is Trilliant:question:
Trilliant.ai is a platform for fashion product reviews with pictures and videos. We are creating a shopping experience that allows you to find clothes recommended by other shoppers like you. We’re focused on bringing representation to diverse body types and reducing the environmental impact of returns and unsustainable supply chains.

## Users - Who Will Use this Product?
People who are tired of being ignored or scammed by online fashion retailers.

## Product Value - What Problem Will This Product Idea solve:question:
People who are taller or curvier than typical fashion models can use this platform to find clothing in their size and price range.

## Changes Made by Our Team
We are working on advanced search features that will allow users to identify their body shape by choosing one of 6 “stunt doubles” who have similar body types. The search will return clothing reviews for clothing that fit a user’s unique body shape.
